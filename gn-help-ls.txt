gn ls <out_dir> [<label_pattern>] [--all-toolchains] [--as=...]
      [--type=...] [--testonly=...]

  Lists all targets matching the given pattern for the given build directory.
  By default, only targets in the default toolchain will be matched unless a
  toolchain is explicitly supplied.

  If the label pattern is unspecified, list all targets. The label pattern is
  not a general regular expression (see "gn help label_pattern"). If you need
  more complex expressions, pipe the result through grep.

Options

  --as=(buildfile|label|output)
      How to print targets.

      buildfile
          Prints the build files where the given target was declared as
          file names.
      label  (default)
          Prints the label of the target.
      output
          Prints the first output file for the target relative to the
          root build directory.

  --all-toolchains
      Normally only inputs in the default toolchain will be included.
      This switch will turn on matching all toolchains.

      For example, a file is in a target might be compiled twice:
      once in the default toolchain and once in a secondary one. Without
      this flag, only the default toolchain one will be matched by
      wildcards. With this flag, both will be matched.

  --testonly=(true|false)
      Restrict outputs to targets with the testonly flag set
      accordingly. When unspecified, the target's testonly flags are
      ignored.

  --type=(action|copy|executable|group|loadable_module|shared_library|
          source_set|static_library)
      Restrict outputs to targets matching the given type. If
      unspecified, no filtering will be performed.

Examples

  gn ls out/Debug
      Lists all targets in the default toolchain.

  gn ls out/Debug "//base/*"
      Lists all targets in the directory base and all subdirectories.

  gn ls out/Debug "//base:*"
      Lists all targets defined in //base/BUILD.gn.

  gn ls out/Debug //base --as=output
      Lists the build output file for //base:base

  gn ls out/Debug --type=executable
      Lists all executables produced by the build.

  gn ls out/Debug "//base/*" --as=output | xargs ninja -C out/Debug
      Builds all targets in //base and all subdirectories.

  gn ls out/Debug //base --all-toolchains
      Lists all variants of the target //base:base (it may be referenced
      in multiple toolchains).
